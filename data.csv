1,1," being able to talk about your major or your class without having your notes in front of you just being able to explain it to somebody else. That's not in that class. I mean, Gpa is a quantitative measure of success. if you're able to sit down with someone and talk about it at length and explain someone else's theory, or what you're learning about, I feel like. That's a good measure that you have it down.

Yeah, I mean, I have seen that Kind of unfortunate sometimes, because it gets harder to have a conversation with someone that's not really passionate about what they're doing. if you're in that, Major, and you struggle to talk about it. You maybe should take different classes.

I think NAU has been a great environment for me. There's I need a lot of quiet places to study and figure things out and there's plenty of places to do that. And I think, being able to make my own schedule and having that flexibility is really good cause I can really plan out my day. And it's very predictable And I need that kind of stability to be successful.

To figure out like, Okay, when am I going to work on a certain project? And who can I talk to? So any who's been great. I'd like to stay and maybe do a master's program here, too, because I like the environment so much.

I mean, I think it's person to person, really, but I also think it's an age thing. I would not have been doing these kinds of things a few years ago if I had left right after high school. To come to college. So I feel like starting college a little later is really good because I have a appreciation now for being in a classroom that I didn't have at 18. I wasn't that interested in school at 18, but now I'm way more interested, like I'm having so much I appreciate the content so much more now. But I feel like faculty could do more to show like why it's interesting or where it applies. Like. for example, we learn about math and classes. But you don't actually get to like, learn about how that plays into like every aspect of life. For example. You're like the application in the environment.

It plays one of the things, and I feel like we don't really get that as much Yeah, and more problem solving, things like, I've had some faculty that have tried to implement more appliance based things like here. Here are the facts and rules that we've learned about. And here's a hypothetical, I've had some law legal classes like that, and those have been really satisfying to just be given time in a whiteboard to just kind of work it out like problem solve. So those have been my favorite classes. The problem solving.",0.267,-0.034,Obliged
2,1,"I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do. But As far as who I am. Yeah, I would say last year was my first year, and then I'm actually graduating next semester. I'm planning to go to law school. So I'm gonna I actually take the LSAT in about less than a month now, or actually a little more than a month And then I'll be applying in like August for law schools. So that's my goal is to go. Be a lawyer. that's just my minor as computer science. So I just did that cause I'm interested in it. I need a minor and I've done like I work in it right now. And I've worked in it previously. So it's kind of like a hobby. But Not what I end up wanting to pursue for my job. I mean, I'm not positive right now as of right now. I'm probably leaning more towards defense but going through law school. I wanna know, obviously a lot more what I'm really interested in.

An internship with the Coconino County public defender's office over the summer, and then today. but I have gone on a few ride along. They were certainly fun. You know. It's interesting. since coming to college. My perspective on things has changed a lot over these last few years after you know everything I've learned, and such.
I took those I did those right along last year. I think the end of first semester beginning of second semester. They were definitely enlightening.

For me to consider myself being successful, It's more than just getting a degree that's obviously part of it. And the piece of paper that you can show your future employment. But it has a lot to do with like, truly learning while you're here, and not just learning knowledge, learning and invaluable skills, like writing skills, critical thinking skills, communication skills. I think all of that is part of college that a lot of people overlook or things that like people will be taking. You know their Gen Ed classes, their English, their math or whatnot, and they're like, Oh, let's get me out of here. You know my major courses. And while I can certainly see some classes might be boring. I still think they're valuable in the kinds of skills that you gain. Even if you're not gonna use the specific knowledge that you get from them. So I think that has a lot to do with this success. And then for me personally also, success means good grades especially going to law school want to have a good Gpa. As I can to get into a good law school, so that's part of it as well. 
I have started looking. There's a handful that I think I'm gonna apply to. I mostly want to stay in like the western side of the States. So I'm thinking, like, somewhere in like Colorado, Utah, Idaho, maybe Washington or Oregon, Somewhere kind of around that area. I'm a big mountain guy and like just nature Guy. So I love it in those areas.",0.146,-0.069,Obliged
3,1,"do my classes. I have a whiteboard, and I write like it's right like where I can see it. So on the wall. So I write the assignments for the week, and then I'll do them.
I'll do my assignments like a few at least a few days early, or try to finish out that whole week, so that then I can take time out for myself. So I'm not like worried about my assignments and trying to do them last minute. I found that doing them early for the week gives me time.

That's when I take time out to do activities that I enjoy. Very easy [to get sucked into it]. Yes, there's parties, I would say, probably every weekend, and people always saying, Oh, there's party and drugs and alcohol, and so you can probably get out of that as quick as you probably get here. If you decide to go to one of those parties.

In the future, I am preparing myself to be Like being independent. It kind of gives you like an idea of what it's like to be like away from home. If you are, let's say, probably moving out on your own, and kind of set you up like step by step in your career. I also like learning new college experiences, meeting new people which can give me more views on life and not be kind of just compressed into one view of how life should be. Get to learning different advice from different people, I would say. and the overall college experience is pretty good for me.

I would say, depending on whoever teaches a lot of teaching methods, I would say that a lot of teachers like when they teach when they basically base your knowledge level on how you do. On test. I would say your knowledge is shouldn't be based off a test. It should be based off. How you do overall, can you up? Can you basically learn over time and not learn in like a little small period, and then have tests and then be like, okay, this is how you're doing in this class and be based off, agreed.

 For me , success is not about really what you have. It's about what you know. So to me, success is, if I'm doing something that I love or doing something that I enjoy and I can learn from that and expand from that and help someone else in the future. Then I feel like you're in this. You're already in a successful place. Just by doing that.",0.182,-0.053,Obliged
4,2," stacking of certain things. I lost a very good friend, unfortunately, like a good family friend. So that happened, and then I felt a lot of pressure to maintain my relationships with my friends, and I felt like they weren't pouring as much into me as I was pouring into them, and then I was having so much school work, and I do maintain a job while I'm a student here at Nau so that on top of it, so it was just a big stacking of all the different things that I had going on in my life. It wasn't necessarily one big thing that happened.

I think being successful is setting clear goals for yourself a clear purpose to complete college. If you don't really know why you're getting into this. It's really hard to want to continue because I have a strong desire to finish my degree and go on to do whatever it is. I feel like God's calling me to do have a better mindset throughout my college experience. But if you don't really have any clear goals. It's really hard. So I would say, that's a big thing. I think I had a good an idea about what I wanted to do when I came to Nau. but I didn't have a clear vision for the future. I just kind of felt a desire to pursue the degree. I'm a part of and as I've continued on, probably in the more recent months, as I'm preparing for an internship, I've realized where I would like to specialize in, and that was a good relief, like understanding where I'm really passionate about and where I would like to be in the future. So probably a little bit later into my college degree is where I got a solidified idea of where I would want to go.

Through the relationships I have with whether it be like my significant other, my friendships, or my family. I've witnessed how they have strengthened me. And through my interactions with them I've realized where I'm really at communicating with people, and where, maybe where I'm not. So they've helped in that that sense, I would say. I feel like my biggest strength is how open I am to discussion about hard things. I'm willing to talk about things that are going on in my life, and if I wasn't it would be really hard. So I feel like, that's a really big strength of mine is just my communication skills. it's really hard you can to some degree, but it also just takes in a little bit of vulnerability which is so scary. And I'm not gonna force someone to be vulnerable with me. So it's something you gotta come to on your own. I'd say.",0.052,-0.09,

Whether it's prescribed or not. So I could have that concern for someone. I had  a project I needed to do. It was a research project. I was really enjoying it. I really enjoyed the subject matter, but it required a lot of finding translations, because my sources from another country which made sense for what I was trying to do, since it was a historical topics. So it took place over a hundred years ago, and the majority of the articles and material I needed was from that time period in that country. So it was definitely a lot of meeting patience with getting these articles and pieces of information translated. And so it was definitely a lot of being stressed that I'm not going to be able to get all the sources I need.

I'm not going to be able to get all of this information done in time to not only write my research paper. but present my research presentation. And I ended up having to take an incomplete and do the paper later, because I just wasn't able to get all of the information I needed in time but also because I became so worked up about this that I got to a point where my brain literally just would not let me focus on it

This problem is too big. I'm going to ignore it, no matter how much I actually wanted to do it. And I understood that it needed to be done, and if I got it done that stress would go away. But I literally just could not make myself focus on it.

it just felt like I got stuck or punched right in my pride cause I've tried so hard. and I had struggled so much. And then I had to do this incomplete. and it just really made it hard to accept I'm a failure. I'm I disappointed myself. And so it was definitely a lot of retrospect of reminiscing on. If I could have just focused better if I could have just gotten out of my head better. If I could have just did this, this or this, then I wouldn't have had to do this.

I can definitely see how I may not personally be interested in taking a stimulant medication. Nonprescription, prescription up
wise or my problems with focusing and dealing with these kind of blockages that popped in my head when I get overwhelmed.
But I can certainly see how that that fear, that anxiety, that worry about disappointment and failure could lead somebody to think that taking a non prescription would be the best for them.",0.07,-0.109,

I feel like that's definitely helps me in life. And with school especially, but feel like having those breathing exercises, and while being outside and staring at the mountain like it just hit so good.

Think of what success is. even after college, he's like, well, you gotta get straight to it, like, you know. Go find like your career. I'm not really a career oriented person like, I wish I could say I had really big dreams when I was a kid. I'm very much like whatever makes me happy, you know,  I could sit here and be. I had a lot of money in my college career. I only work part time, and only makes enough for me to like put food on the table most of the time. Thankfully.

I think maybe the only thing I can think is. you know, I think the family unit is really important. And I think a lot of kids when they go to college like you're at that age where, like, you don't want to listen to your parents, or you know what I mean, and when you have a teacher.
Pushing their own opinions on things and trying like almost seeming like they're like catering to the students and making friendship with these students. It's easy for those students to be like, Hey, like? Well.
my parents really are like pieces of shit and like no, that's not it like you don't have to agree with your parents, but, like that family unit like, got you into college and like has been successful, you know, like, if it wasn't successful Be where you are, you know.

Kill some of that frustration for not knowing those things

some part of me wants good grades, and so, like you get a good job. But I think if you get good grades and don't understand what you learned or like had the ability to Question what happened throughout The entirety of your college like if you don't leave people to wonder if I wasn’t doing it right.

That's kind of where I'm at now. I've kind of grown out of the like 4 Gpa. Kind of a thing, and moved more towards asking a good question.
Cause you have some of the smartest people you'll ever meet around you, specifically designedlike in your field. That's their expertise.

That's what I've been trying to grow more in, and just ask those questions. while I'm bad at reading them like hearing what other people understand from scholarly articles almost makes me want to read them, like books, or something like that, where they maybe have Statistics, but in like a nicely laid out way, so like just learning how other people learn so that I can learn about other people's learning styles and how their brain works. So it's been really nice to like pick some people's brains. And like some people just need to be thrown in the deep end. And that's kind of me.but I like having some of the like technical background knowledge, and it definitely helps if I can have somebody to tell me like to talk it through like a discussion. So that is nice to have teachers around to know things, but also would have discussions about it.

I think [college is] a good place to make a lot of mistakes. I think people try to expect perfection in college, and I think like that is, that is literally the not the point. we're doing our intern internships. And I'm trying to get a specific internship because it's the place, I think I'll Fail the most, while I have the most supports in place, having people to ask questions, and I will do a lot of things, and I'll probably not do them perfectly, or the best that I think I can. But I'll learn how they would do it differently, how I could do it differently, what kind of things I could learn.

I think one thing is like encouraging questions. I think it's very difficult in like certain settings, because it depends a lot on the classmates and whether or not like you just have a class that asks a lot of questions.

He was just sitting across for me and we were all forced to work together, like tables. So we just really hit it off.

I'd say emotional support. So if I'm like Going through a hard math problem. I'll send my sister the problem, and she's a high schooler, so she'll be like, yes. we'll like have some fun with it, because she has no clue what to do. So I just show her what I'm doing and just kind of just talk.
Personally, I feel like NAU does a good job. But something I've noticed is the bigger classrooms my freshman here I took like an art class, for like a general elective, and it was just like so big. There were like 300 students in it, and it was so big that not everybody could fit int. I'm in a class right now with about 20 people, and it's much more personal. So the professor can meet every student's need, and it feels like you can be attached to the work. You feel more motivated.

 Well, I don't really know, because it's more like a like a personal level, because You just don't care about your work. There's not much that external forces can really do like a professor can only do so much for a student. But I guess just like what I was saying, having a more personal level with your professor, get to know them better and like form bonds. Then you can feel like your works more worth doing.
 something that's just really hard, and you just drop it. You just think it's easier just to not do it. Just not start it at all. get help like from your professor, because they have like office hours, and they're here to help us. So like, if you don't understand something, you can talk to them directly for more help.
forming bonds in class, like with friends, make friends so, or like study groups, so you can't. So you don't have to necessarily do it alone. if you don't understand something you can like get help from another student, and vice versa.
students can work together to try to understand and work towards what they're doing. if I get through it all I force myself through it like I'll end up with a headache. but I feel like pacing myself better with [more breaks].

Technically, it's more hands-on work and specific to my majors. So I'm getting a lot more practice and actual content that like relates to what I'm going to be doing. So it's exciting to be in that stage.

I think some students wanna graduate. But I think by default, if you're getting A's, you're gonna have learned quite a bit. To get as and courses. You have to know kind of what you're doing so, or actually do the reading or do the studying. So it's like default of wanting A's. You probably will learn what you want to learn. You need to learn.

I was getting bad grades, but, in my opinion, bad grades. I didn't ever get Cs high school and I started getting Cs in college. And it was hard to get Cs after.

I think, make courses more geared towards learning than grades. Probably learning the content. Then you get a good grade. It's not about like It's more about. Do you demonstrate that you learned what you're supposed to learn like dot unit. but also announcements of it like not so many tests, but more I don't know, but maybe more writing, because multiple choice is just not really representative of what you really know.

I think also, we were talking just about community I'm really, I think I found success in the friends that I've made, and classes and outside of classes that's really important for me. And another thing is, I'm very future orientated. Since I've gotten into a grad program from my undergraduate work I think that just shows almost the most success that I can do something with my time that I spent here, and that it is being reflected over into my future.


Well, my grad program is 5 years long. So it's a doctor of psychology. So not a Phd more practical. I think about after all the school work, I think about my internship year and what that's gonna be like and where I'm gonna go. And then I wanna be a forensic psychologist. So I envision myself testifying in court and doing assessments on clients.

So I mean, it's hard to think about what exactly it's gonna be like. But I think about it. And I have those goals in my head that I want.

So my major is psychology. And so there was a part of me when I started college. That kind of knew I was in it for the long haul. But until Junior year, when I started really thinking about grad applications and had a class that was almost revolved specifically in future psychology degrees with grad. That is, when I really got kicked into gear. And I was like, Okay, it's good time, like it's future time. But I definitely wasn't always like that.

for like, for example, in one of my labs, I reported the wrong thing, and I felt really upset at myself in the moment, and I was really like I was beating myself up so bad. But then I, after, like the initial like Mini breakdown. I was almost like more inspired to work harder and show myself for the next week, like I did like 3 hours of extra work just like on my own. I want to prove myself because I have that diagnosis label that just makes me go like even harder and like full. crazy mode.

But like when you really break it down like there is, there is enough time for you just have to make time for it.

I would say, being successful means like feeling fulfilled in what you do, and feeling like you're proud to be doing what you're doing
I think there's a misconception that success means like money, or it means power, or it means just having some sort of like stake in something. But sometimes success means like I did my laundry today, I got out of bed today. Cause that's like what you can do for that day. And I feel like success. Just means like you do what you accomplish your goals, and you do what makes you happy? Not necessarily because it gets you anything like any sort of monetary thing. If that makes any sense.  I would say mostly yes, I would say like, it's probably like a 60, 40 type of situation where I feel like very fulfilled in what I do. I'm really proud of what I do. I love what I do, and I feel very like fulfilled by it, and I feel very like I do make a difference in what I'm doing, which is a good feeling. But then there are other things like on the Flip side, where I feel like, especially in the past year, with just like school stress and things like that, that I haven't been able to be like the best friend I could be. And that's definitely taken a toll, and like what I view is like success, because that's like, not who I am, and what the values that I hold like close to myself. I really value like friendship and showing up for your friends and being there for the people in your life, and I feel like I haven't been as present as I could be. So in that aspect I feel like success has been a little lacking.
Yeah, I would say, it's a little bit of both (part my fault and part external) that are getting in the way. I feel like initially, I get like, well, I hadn't an assignment due. But then I'm like, well, I could have done that last week, or I could have done that yesterday, instead of cancelling on my friend like I could have done that like I feel like when I'm initially like, especially if somebody confronts me about it. I'm like, Well, I'm busy like I have school. I have this, and then, after I kind of say with it, I'm like, well, like I made a commitment to them, and I told them that I would see them at this time, and I didn't, and that's like that's what it boils down to is that I didn't.

There is gonna be bumps in the roads for everyone. It's gonna be unexpected things. It's just I think me as a person, I think, since

I think it did make me a better person, but I feel like it also made me grow up faster than some people

there are bumps in the roads, but it's whether or not like you can handle it, or can you not handle it. Like the whole like community incident. Yeah, that was crappy. But there was something that I couldn't do about it. would I fail or Was it more important to fail? Or was it more important to go to the funeral, which luckily I did go visit her. So I think that's kind of would also help me in my decision.

I think I handle situations a lot better. The older I get, depending on what they are. I mean, yeah, it's gonna be. It might be sad or stuff like that. But. It's in my mindset. School is more important. My career is more important.

 Yeah, well, so my major is like is criminal justice. And then I'm minoring in psychology. career mindset of what I really want to do is gonna be like a detective and stuff like that like solving crimes.

A police officing is not what I want to do, but it's something I have to do to go into my career field. And I think working on this major, since being a junior in high school.

I have one more year, cause I am a junior. I think, is really what helped me to get more like success in life. It's because I did get 12 college credits my 2 last years of high school before I even started college. And I've been with this major for like 4 years now. 5.

I think that's like what helps me. And like, I know what I want to do. So I'm determined to get it done because I want to succeed in that career field. I want to be able to do that. So I think that's what happened or not. What's happened. I think that's what helped me the most.",-0.033,-0.053,

You find anyone kind of anywhere, and they all just make you feel good.
 I never really like reached out for accommodations, because, like in my mindset, I feel like someone else is probably having it a lot worse than I am, and I don't wanna be able to take a resource from someone else. but like for friends, I am the advocate who's like, Hey, you really need to reach out like you need to get help with like, let's make sure you get this. I'm known for, like writing a random care report throughout the year of just like someone who needs it.so like, I try my best to use the resources. But I'm pretty much just like I give the resources to other people rather than myself.

 Yeah, I've had a few people in my building who had to like reach out to be like, Hey, I've been really struggling this semester. I'm go going to fail all of my classes like I don't know what to do, and he's been pretty good about it like they reach out to the professors like any, you will do it for you.

But I don't want to get discouraged by it. I think it's also like having a good like work life balance. I guess, like school being the work, but having also, like, you know, meeting people and like having community connection stuff, I think.

Cause if that's school accomplishment. But college, I think, is part of it, is making a community. Yeah, I definitely in high school, I was more stressing about getting straight As and stuff, and like all the academic like, I took super hard classes, and I just really push myself, and I think that's good sometimes. But I kind of burned out, I guess, cause it was just a lot of pressure. Yeah, I think it's more important for me to like gain community and stuff, because my major is like more community oriented. So I think, like the academic side of it is important definitely. But like part of it is just meeting people and getting connections and all that stuff.

 So I think it's important to Foster that or like, practice it.

 Yeah, I think. As I like, I'm getting into the more advanced classes, and it's like specific topics. My professors all have, like a lot of experience in the field. So like the class itself, is really helpful. But like, it's the teachers that really like help the most, because the material is stuff like, yeah, I could read this in the textbook, but it's like the professors giving like their experience on it.

But I'm also like really nervous that, like, I'm not gonna get the perfect grades.

 I definitely was an adjustment after my first year, just because when I went to college, I wanted to get straight as and stuff like that. But I realized that in the classes like I got like B's and but still I learned so much, and which doesn't make any sense in my head. But I've realized I just learned so much. But like I feel like my grade didn't really show it. I'm also a horrible test taker. So that's probably why. But, like I can tell you everything I learned in all my classes. 

 No, I'm not taking any economics classes, but like and any tests in general, I'm not good at. So that's probably why I'm doing good at any of my classes like Test wise, but like I can tell you anything about it. My classes. It definitely is very frustrating to [deal with the gap between a sense of accomplishment and grades]. But I feel like only one person who's advocating isn't gonna do enough if that makes any sense. So if I feel like I told my teachers that are like, Okay, but, like all these other students are doing good, so like. Why can't you get what I? I'm not sure if I'm making any sense right now. But.

I just feel like I keep [fighting]. I fight the semester. I'm trying different ways to study better and just trying to get my grades better. Honestly like that's all I'm trying to. I mean, I have good grades, but I'm trying to get them better and bring my Gpa. I feel like each semester. I mean, train different ways like to study better, or to at least just like get where I want to be grade wise.

But I just wish that, like it was not in all my classes, but in majority of my classes, because, I feel like some of my classes that I'm taking cause I'm a sociology major.

I mean, there's also an issue of just general busyness like, especially once you get further into the semester, it can be difficult. Kind of find the time in the day to do everything especially like I'm pretty active in school clubs and events and organizations, so I could be doing upwards of like 2 or 3 things per week like every day. So that's not really an issue, though mentally, that's more of just like overbooking oneself. I mean, I think they do a pretty good job of making sure that things don't overlap, and that students know what they're getting into in terms of like advisors. I'm not sure I could really think of anything they could do to improve.

The only concern that I would have is that having a diagnosis like that does come with its own set of stigmas in terms of future careers, and profiling for those sort of things, whereas, like I know, it's not legally, most companies are not allowed to discriminate against people with mental health conditions such as that, but that is not to say that they won't.  So I would certainly love to get evaluated for that sort of a thing, but in terms of an actual doctor's diagnosis that might be a little more difficult. I also would say that stigma and perceptions that are steering some students away from seeking proper assessment of medical needs.


I feel like I have a fairly strong support group amongst, like my friends, my family, my peers.

I think that it's building friendships, and I think it's having a good basis for which your major is applied. I'll just say that kind of vaguely. I do feel, though, in some classes I didn't learn much, and I will say that that's not the Professor's fault. I think that that was very much the work that I put in even if that wasn't reflected upon. My final grade.

A 101 class will be good to suffice that but then I kept reading over the choices, and one was human rights. And I was like, even though that's a 200 level course. I'm willing to take that over any 101 course, just because that's interesting to me.

This doesn't come directly from you, but it comes from my peers, but having to have the mindset of like. Oh, I'm in debt. like I should be productive, and it's a greater sense of guilt, because when you're enjoying life. but I still owe a lot of money like I could be working right now, and alleviating that to some degree to me that came in forms of like going out.

I know that my parents are paying for part, and They have high expectations for what I should be doing, and I feel like it's not the same type of guilt, but it is. I should be doing something I should not be, you know, like I'm hanging out. From coming out of state many programs weren't really advertised to me at the very beginning. So I did have to put my part in reaching out and being a part of those, so I'd say, becoming involved as an out of state student was a bit difficult.

I didn't take a first seminar class. I know that that's taught. And maybe some programs go into those classes and are taught. Classes like these are some available options, but I didn't take that. So I don't know. Maybe offer those the same way that Students come in to talk about study abroad, I think, but that'd be great. I think that over the course of my undergraduate career I've heard over 20 study abroad presentations. And that might just be the program that I'm in. But I think it's pretty u universal across all majors. So perhaps do that, or maybe do a showcasing of the clubs and ways to be involved on campus during the semester. Maybe like twice to be more involved, to, to meet other people with similar interests, I think, would be great, because you get to establish there.

I've always been like 40 HA week working jobs on top of like studying as hard. So like some semesters, I'm basically full time. I'll be at like 12 credits. It's like one class.
